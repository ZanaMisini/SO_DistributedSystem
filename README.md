Project Description: Distributed System using Inter Process Comunications
(IPC), Threads, and Synchronization

In this project, you should design and implement a distributed system using IPC, threads, and
synchronization in C on Linux. The system will consist of a server that can handle requests from multiple
clients simultaneously. The clients will communicate with the server using pipes, message passing or
shared memory.
The server has the following tasks:
1. Handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously using threads.
2. Limit the maximum number of clients that can connect to the server.
3. Echo back the client's request data in the response.
The mechanisms that the server should imeplement:
1. Message Passing
2. Shared Memory
3. Pipes
You must use also proper synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or semaphores to share the
resources properly.

Basic Requirements
1. Your implementation should include a server program that can handle requests from multiple
clients using IPC mechanisms, threads, and synchronization.
2. The server program should be able to handle a maximum number of clients, with the maximum
number specified in a constant or configuration file.
3. Clients should be able to connect to the server and send requests using IPC mechanisms.
4. The server should echo back the client's request data in the response.
5. The implementation should demonstrate proper use of synchronization mechanisms to ensure
that resources are properly shared and protected.
6. The implementation should be well-documented and easy to understand.
Bonus Requirements
1. Implement client programs that can connect to the server using IPC mechanisms and send
requests.
2. Implement error handling for all IPC functions used in the implementation.
Deliverables
1. The server program source code.

2. A README file that includes instructions for building and running the program, as well as a brief
overview of the implementation.
3. Any necessary client program source code (if bonus requirements are completed).
4. Any configuration files necessary to run the program.
5. Documented word file with the description of all your work (the document should be formated
and in the proper form i.e table of content, list of figures, references, etc.)
